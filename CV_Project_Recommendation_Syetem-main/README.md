# CV_Project_Recommendation_Syetem
## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of visual recommendation for Pokémon characters using the DINO-V2 model, a self-supervised vision transformer. The system analyzes images to determine visual similarities and recommends Pokémon with shared traits.

## Features
Feature Extraction: Utilizes DINO-V2 to extract rich visual features from Pokémon images.

Similarity Analysis: Employs cosine similarity to assess and visualize the similarities between Pokémon.

Heatmap Visualizations: Includes heatmap generation to illustrate the relationship between different Pokémon based on their visual features.

## Technology
DINO-V2: A vision transformer model that learns visual representations in a self-supervised manner, more information of the model on https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2. 

Python: For scripting and running the model.

LaTeX: Used for generating the project report and visualizing results.

## Usage
Data: Pokémon images dataset from Kaggle and Huggingface.

Labeled Dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gDwqU72cZt0CFwLb512qXY-2Yn5HB-rM?usp=sharing

Unlabeled Dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZbP-ksYeS_yvyW4To9DQ9GfxFXorq7S2?usp=sharing

Run: Execute the model script to generate feature vectors and similarity heatmaps.

## Results
This project successfully demonstrates the capability of DINO-V2 in capturing nuanced visual similarities among Pokémon, aiding in the recommendation of visually similar characters.
